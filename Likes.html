      I like things that are black, or in the shade of gray, <br />
      It is a neutral or achromatic color, meaning literally that it is "without
      color",<br />
      because it can be composed of black and white. It is the color of a
      cloud-covered sky, of ash and of lead.

      The artist I listen to most of the time is Post Malone, <br />
      He is a kind of goofy artist, jolly personality, but his music speaks to
      me.<br />
      I also like taking pictures such as on the left side of this page you can
      see Adam Degross <br />
      work, its done in a way of gray shades. Likely I appreciate more that is
      around me if It was seen in a <br />
      achromatopsia kind of sight.
