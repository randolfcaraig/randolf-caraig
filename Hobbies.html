      Most of the time I do ride my bike on my free time, but nowadays I find
      myself <br />
      mostly focusing on doing such things in the house because my dad is
      faraway and I stand as <br />
      the man of the house. With us moving to this new town I tend to find such
      broken things and <br />
      try to fix them along with the house renovation.<br />
      <br />
      As you can see on the left side it was my highlight long ago, I find
      gaming kind of interesting <br />
      because we can communicate and find ourselves in a group with random
      people trying to achieve <br />
      same goal along with the stress on the game phase eventually changing
      every round.
